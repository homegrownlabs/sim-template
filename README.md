# My Simulant Suite

## Running the Sample Service

The only pre-requisite for running the [sample service]() is a working
installation of [Docker]().

After that, just run `run-service.sh` to invoke the proper Docker incantations.

```sh
$ ./run-service.sh
```

If you're on Linux, just add `sudo` in front of that command.
